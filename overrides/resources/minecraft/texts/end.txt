Trainvoi stepped out of the taxi and took his first breath of the dense tropical air. Was this the place? 


He checked his invitation again. 101 Catspaw Lane, Miami Florida. 


Damn Sailor, Trainvoi thought. Sending him all the way here from Vietnam, and for what? 


Sailor's message was a cryptic one, only ":3" followed by an address and a plane ticket. 


Nevertheless, he took the whole flight there, and trudged along through the Florida streets to here.


Trainvoi sighed, already exhausted from jetlag. Only 100 days here, right? Shouldn't be that bad. Trainvoi fumbled with his copy of the keys and placed his hand on the doorknob. No turning back now.


Begrudgingly, he opened the door. 


"Reimu Touhou?!" he gasped.


Reimu Touhou refrained from making any sudden movements. If she didn't move, she reasoned, Trainvoi wouldn't be able to see her. With her free hand, she felt around for the shotgun kept near the door. The shotgun prepared for this exact scenario. The shotgun with Trainvoi's name on it.


Trainvoi didn't say a word. 


Reimu took a deep breath. To take a life, even the life of a Gregtech player, was too horrible to contemplate. Every muscle in her body was prepared to bolt. Her entire being felt like pins and needles. The electrical impulse of violence surged through her very being as she pumped the shotgun in preparation for the deed.


With a single motion, she raised the shotgun up to Trainvoi's face and pulled the trigger.


Nothing. The shot sprayed out onto the street, succeeding only in nailing a mailman on the far sidewalk.


"遅い" Trainvoi growled. He pinched his fingers together like an Italian; the key for opening his domain. 


"Domain Expansion," Trainvoi shouted, "infinite gooning!"


At first Reimu felt nothing. But the tendrils of Trainvoi's domain took hold around her. Reaching, grasping at the walls and floor like roots. And in a moment, all was subsumed into Trainvoi's domain.


"gg" Trainvoi said as he shut the door behind him.


Trainvoi turned away from the door. Was his work truly done here? A presence behind him suggested otherwise. 


"What have you done to her?!" screamed a panicked voice. There was something else there too. The rattle of a rifle.


"I saved her to my favorites," Trainvoi explained, "she's gone now."


Trainvoi slowly turned around. The next girl looked similar; clearly a shrine maiden as well. This must be Sanae.


"You bring her back!" Sanae cried, tears streaming down her face, "bring her back now goddamnit!"


"Too late," Trainvoi answered. Sanae's blood ran cold. Her rifle, feeling heavy in her sweatsoaked hands, slipped out of her grasp. She let it clatter to the floor. 


Trainvoi made a finger gun with his right hand. It was over for her. It was Sanaeover. 


Sanae took a step towards him. If only she could reach him somehow. "She never meant to harm you. We were gonna have fun here. We were going to be friends. Or even more," Sanae pleaded, "isn't that what you wanted?"


Trainvoi just raised his hand to her forehead and growled "never gooned."


Then Sanae died. Not a puff of smoke, nor a flash of light, not even a scream heralded her end. She just vanished; no more fanfare than hitting a delete button.
