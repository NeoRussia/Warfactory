Fork for Cleanroom loader 0.2.2-alpha of https://github.com/MisterNorwood/Warfactoy forge version

Still requires manual install of Cleanroom loader 0.2.2-alpha (just drag the minecraft folder into .minecraft folder after you import the Cleanroom loader instance) 

I took the liberty of updating several mods so there is no parity with head branch currently.

Cleanroom release download: https://github.com/CleanroomMC/Cleanroom/releases/tag/0.2.2-alpha

For forge version, include !mixinbooter-9.1 (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mixin-booter/files/5079135) and !configanytime-3.0 (https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/configanytime/files/5212709)
